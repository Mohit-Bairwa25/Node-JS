CommonJS modules and ES6 (ECMAScript) modules:

Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Loading:
CommonJS (CJS): It uses synchronous loading. Dependencies are loaded on demand while executing the code.
ES6 Modules (ESM): ESM pre-parses the code to resolve imports before execution. This means that errors related to imports are caught during parsing (before runtime), unlike CJS where errors might occur during execution.

Syntax and Usage:
CJS: In Node.js, CommonJS modules load using require and export using module.exports.
ESM: ES6 modules use import and export statements for loading and exporting respectively. They provide a clearer syntax and better support for asynchronous loading.

Environment Support:
CJS: Primarily used in server-side development with Node.js.
ESM: Aligns with the ECMAScript standard and is increasingly relevant in both browser and server contexts.

Interoperability:
CJS: Lacks interoperability between different module systems.
ESM: Provides better interoperability due to its standardization and native support in modern browsers.

In summary, while CommonJS is simpler and synchronous, ES6 modules offer better syntax, asynchronous loading, and broader compatibility
