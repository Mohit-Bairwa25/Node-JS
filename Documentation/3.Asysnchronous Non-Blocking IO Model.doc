Node.js Overview:
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.
Itâ€™s built on the V8 JavaScript engine (used by Chrome) and provides server-side capabilities.
Node.js enables you to create scalable, event-driven, and efficient applications.

Asynchronous and Non-Blocking:
Node.js achieves non-blocking I/O through its event loop mechanism.
The event loop is a single-threaded loop that continuously checks for pending events and executes associated callbacks.
When an asynchronous I/O operation (e.g., reading a file, making an HTTP request) is initiated, Node.js registers a callback function to be executed once the operation completes.
This non-blocking approach allows Node.js to handle multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for each one to finish before moving on.

Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Example:
In the synchronous version, the entire execution waits for the file read to complete, while the asynchronous version allows other tasks to proceed.

Advantages of Non-Blocking I/O:
Scalability: Node.js can handle many concurrent connections efficiently.
Responsiveness: Applications remain responsive even during I/O operations.
Event-Driven: Callbacks allow you to respond to events (e.g., HTTP requests, database queries) as they occur.
