nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.

Installation
Either through cloning with git or by using npm (the recommended way):

npm install -g nodemon
And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:

npm install --save-dev nodemon
With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path or you can't use it directly from the command line. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as npm start) or using npx nodemon.

To use a file with nodemon
nodemon .\index.js
